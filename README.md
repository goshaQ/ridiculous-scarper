### Graph Data Model
We use pretty simple data model which contains two entities and single relationship between them. For now, the main objective is to capture the relationship between a company and its representatives. All of the company details are stored as properties of the corresponding node. For sure, this is not an optimal design, however further improvements require a better understanding of how should the interaction with the database take place, or what the database search queries are of interest.

The definition of the data model is shown in the image below.
